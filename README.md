# IBM Cloud Private Installation Workshop

### **Overview**

In support of the desire to gain experience with containers and container orchestration, this education session centered on IBM Cloud Private, IBM's on-premise offering based on Docker and Kubernetes. This session is a first step on a journey to using this technology in development of next generation applications. It will help BB&T gain a better understanding of the technology, how to implement it and how to develop applications using it.

IBM Cloud Private is a full on-premise private cloud platform based that adds important enterprise-grades qualities of services such as logging, monitoring, auditing, and encryption to the base container and container orchestration functionality. It runs on any Linux platform and can provides integration with your existing data and services.


### **Learning Objectives**

- cluster design and resource planning
- cluster installation / configuration
- understand the Kubernetes model for deploying and managing applications
- discuss existing application processes and how they may be modified as a result of this model
- learn how to quantify resource requirements in preparation for building a cluster

### **The benefit of this workshop**

- focused education that will drive critical understanding with a minimum investment of time
- opportunity to identify and shore up gaps in the current plan to build a test environment around containers
- participate in building an IBM Cloud Private environment without the constraints of working in a locked down environment
- begin planning and discovery for building a target cluster and evaluation

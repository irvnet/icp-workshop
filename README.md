# IBM Cloud Private Installation Workshop

### **Overview**

In support of the desire to gain experience with containers and container orchestration as a potential basis for an architectural basis for application development, IBM is providing an education session centered on IBM Cloud Private, our on-premise offering based on Docker and Kubernetes. This session is a first step on a journey to using this technology in development of next generation applications. It will help BB&T gain a better understanding of the technology, how to implement it and how to develop applications using it. This will help position BB&T to thrive in a rapidly evolving banking ecosystem.

IBM Cloud Private is a full on-premise private cloud platform based that adds important enterprise-grades qualities of services such as logging, monitoring, auditing, and encryption to the base container and container orchestration functionality. It runs on any Linux platform and can provides integration with your existing data and services.


### **Learning Objectives**

- cluster design and resource planning
- cluster installation / configuration
- understand the Kubernetes model for deploying and managing applications
- discuss existing application processes and how they may be modified as a result of this model
- learn how to quantify resource requirements and restrictions in preparation for requests to build a cluster

### **The benefit of this workshop**

- focused education that will drive critical understanding with a minimum investment of time
- opportunity to identify and shore up gaps in the current plan to build a test environment around containers
- participate in building an IBM Cloud Private environment without the constraints of working in the secure BB&T core environment
- begin filling out a planning guide to help plan a target cluster and evaluation with much more accuracy and experience
